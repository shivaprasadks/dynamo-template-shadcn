## Installation Guide

`@cleartax/icons` is available as a [GitHub package](https://github.com/ClearTax/icons/packages).

**Since this library is published on GitHub Packages, You need an access token from `GitHub` to install**

Click on this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package) for more information or follow these steps:

1. Go to the `Settings` > `Developer Settings` then click on `Personal access tokens` or just click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click on `Generate new token`, give some name to your token and check `read:packages` from the list of available scopes. Finally _COPY_ the newly generated token.
3. You can either add this token in your global `~/.npmrc` or in the local `.npmrc` of your project by adding the below line

```sh
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

4. In your local `.npmrc` add the below line

```sh
@cleartax:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

**Now install the library with**

```sh
// with npm
npm install @cleartax/icons

// with yarn
yarn add @cleartax/icons
```

**Note:** The library has a `peerDependency` of `react` and `react-dom`. So make sure to install them

```sh
// with npm
npm install react react-dom

// with yarn
yarn add react react-dom
```

```js

import { CaretDownIcon, CaretUpIcon } from '@cleartax/icons';

<CaretDownIcon color="#c00" width="15em" height="15em" />
<CaretUpIcon color="#0c0" width="15em" height="15em" />

```

## Adding icons (Contributing)

The react components are generated from svg icons placed in the `src/assets` folder. Put your svg file in this folder. Please ensure the file name is in lowercase and `kebab-cased` viz. `file-name.svg`. This will generate the React component as `FileNameIcon`.

**Note**: The color `#000` in the svg will get replaced by `currentColor` that allows us to change the color of the icon.\*\*

You can locally test the storybook with `yarn storybook` to check if your icon has been created properly. It should show up in the list of icons.

Therafter, you can checkin the icon and raise a PR for integration. Once the PR is merged, the new release will be auto triggered.
